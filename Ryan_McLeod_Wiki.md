# Introduction #
I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and a member of the UCOSP POSIT team.

I'm working on implementing SMS functionality as a function plugin in the new architecture.

# Weekly Progress #

## Nov 29 - Dec 5 ##
SMS sending does not work exactly as intended yet, but the basic functionality of sending an SMS message (by simply specifying a string) is functioning.

## Nov 22-28 ##
Made more progress on the SMS plugin.

## Nov 8-14 ##
Added a function plugin to POSIT that uses the old FilePickerActivity class (with some modifications.) I created an [issue](http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=265&colspec=ID%20Date%20Repository%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Difficulty%20Owner%20Summary&start=100) for it.

New issues:
  * [Issue 261](http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=261#c0) - Fixed by Ralph
  * [Issue 262](http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=262#c0)

## Nov 1-7 ##
Tested out the new changes to POSIT and posted several issues, some of which are new problems and some of which are probably old ones that either weren't noticed before or haven't been posted as issues. I've also been tinkering with the SMS service, but I haven't got anything functional yet. I plan to have at least basic functionality by next week. Also, incidentally, improved this page a lot.

New issues:
  * [Issue 252](http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=252&colspec=ID%20Date%20Repository%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Difficulty%20Owner%20Summary&start=100)

  * [Issue 255](http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=255&colspec=ID%20Date%20Repository%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Difficulty%20Owner%20Summary&start=100)
