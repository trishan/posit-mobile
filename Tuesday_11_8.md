# Administrative Stuff #
  * Midterm evaluations still on the way
  * Stanley did a new blog post which is now published

# Recent Patches #
  * Make sure you test new patches with multiple plugins

# Managing Workflow #
  * Ralph's technique: commit to local repository, make patch, send patch, wait for patch to be pushed, pull new changes into NEW local clone
  * Ryan's technique: commit to local repository, make patch, send patch, wait for patch to be pushed, pull new changes and MERGE the new head with the old one, letting any changes in the new head override the old head.
