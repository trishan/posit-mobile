# Agenda #

The goal of the Code Sprint is:
  * to get our development environments set up;
  * to create a POSIT project in  Eclipse (or other IDE) pulling from the Mercurial Google Code Resository;
  * to experiment with running and testing POSIT on both phones and the Android emulator;
  * to learn how to create new issues on the Google issue tracker and to process issues for the project;
  * develop and test and submit a patch for a simple change to the POSIT codebase.
