Michelle wants grades in by 15th! Would require people to have work finished by the end of the week.

# Project Updates #
**Eric's almost done (Walkthrough posted: http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/wiki/To_Do_Reminder_Walkthrough) Everyone should do one of these.**

**Picture integration with Finds (Gordon's project) may have to made part of the basic POSIT instead of a plugin, and then have the option of being disabled.**
