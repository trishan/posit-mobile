### 2011 01 26 CMPUT 496 (UCOSP) Notes ###

  * Blog is at UCOSP.ca
    * you can link a personal blog to that too
    * Last year’s blog is blog.hfoss.org
  * Sarah's on blog duty for this week, we will rotate
  * Ralph wants a “portfolio” type collection of documents on a wiki for documenting work
  * post project proposal and progress reports there
  * Use google code page to post all this info or google code wiki page
  * Ralph will pull all of them together on the main page
  * Ralph said we did a good job for the weekend
  * Ralph has marked up tickets, many were marked low priority
  * Before doing significant interface changes, must discuss as a group
  * Jon wants to develop an SMS synchronization feature
  * Sarah expressed interest in helping
  * Jon says he can do both that and release manager
  * question of whether it would be a posit-centric project or a general one with posit applications
  * Start of sms code for POSIT at http://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/source/browse?repo=sms#hg%2Fsrc%2Forg%2Fhfoss%2Fposit%2Fsms
  * Aid group may be interested in this feature and we can maybe get a grant to develop it
  * possible clients in Haiti for SMS syncing
  * meeting in feb, give prototype in summer
  * creole interface
  * there will be a team at trinity working on it, but maybe others could help too
  * there's a potential grant related to it but that's probably post-ucosp
  * find out about grant in a couple weeks
  * biologist client at UofA (as well as one at Trinity)
  * She wanted it for iphone, so we'll need to talk about what the project is to her
  * interested in getting many end-users involved
  * Edward will meet with her to show her POSIT
  * good project: working with client to satisify their needs, rather than developing whatever you happen to be interested.
  * Stas is interested in this one
  * many coverage-tracker (esp. UI) issues raised - does anyone want to take those on? (requires an actual phone, not just emulator)
  * everyone please propose:
    * a testing task
    * a refactoring task
  * that you want to take on and that would be useful.
  * Quick proposals due before next week's meeting. Just a couple of sentences in a ticket.
  * work on writing and publishing testing procedures to make them reproducible
  * Week after next we'll probably want quick proposals for the whole semester's work.
  * Let's rotate note taking for each meeting
