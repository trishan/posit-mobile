# Introduction #

Clustering enhances POSIT's map display by grouping Finds by region, thus allowing users to better analyze their data and derive useful inferences about them. By pressing on a particular cluster, a user can view basic information about the Finds in that cluster, and then choose to edit any of those Finds as before.


# Clustering Walkthrough #

  1. Set-up and select a project
  1. Add multiple Finds to your project. Preferably these finds will be from different geographical locations.
  1. On the home screen, click "View Finds"
  1. Choose "Map Finds" from the menu

An enhanced map will be displayed as below:

Upon zoom and pan, Finds will be re-clustered.
