_Captain's Log,Week One: Jan 26, 2012_

- Back from the code sprint in Vancouver with the awesome team.
<br />
- Worked on a very simple "Missing Comment" patch to familiarize myself with the environment (Eclipse and Java need some practice).
<br />
- Today got assigned [Issue 333](https://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=333): Finds that are edited still retain their synced status, even though they should appear unsynced. Beginning work.



&lt;hr&gt;


_Captain's Log,Week Two: Feb 2, 2012_

- Worked on [Issue 333](https://code.google.com/p/posit-mobile/issues/detail?id=333) and produced a patch to fix the issue where Finds that are edited still appear unsynced. The process helped familiarize myself with the environment. Bottom-line the issue was ensuring that once the intent is to Edit, the current Find is set as unsynced.
<br />
- Considering the possibility on working on a barcode scanner plugin for the POSIT app. Jinkies! Will do some research and come up with the plan for the next week.




&lt;hr&gt;


_Captain's Log,Week Three: Feb 9, 2012_

- Begun researching into barcode scanner and including a scanner in POSIT. There is a solution on the net called ZXING that is also open source. Some info here:

http://damianflannery.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/integrate-zxing-barcode-scanner-into-your-android-app-natively-using-eclipse/

It's source code is available so will need to go through it but it lets you use Intents on button presses. More research needed to come up with a seamless transition or figure something other than zxing out as a helper.
<br />
