# Agenda #

  * Discuss projects, answer outstanding questions

# Weekly Updates #

  * Everyone provided updates on their project. Ralph answered questions and gave advice with some important points about the course:

  * Final drafts of project proposals should be in to Ralph by Monday as he is away the rest of the week and more importantly has to submit midterm progress reports.

  * Everyone should be digging into their project as fast as they can now.

  * Open an issue on the tracker for your project under "Enhancements" so we can all follow as you develop.

# For Next Week #

  * Ralph is away at a conference, Trishan will man the meeting.
  * Brittney will do the next blog post
