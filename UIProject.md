# POSIT User Interface Simplification/Unification Project #

## Motivation ##
Currently, the user interface is confusing and hard to use.  There is no default way to interact with each activiy.  This creates a disconnect between what the user wants to do, and how the user can go about achieving that action.  By simplifying and unifying the user interface, the POSIT project will be more appealing to users.

## Implementation ##
With the help of more expierenced HCI professionals, I will design two different interfaces, one consisting primarily of buttons, and one consisting primarily of menus.  Then with user testing, find out which interface (current, menu, or button) is the most user friendly.

## Long term goals ##
  * One default (or at least, self evident way) of interacting with the application
  * A constant interface so the application looks the same throughout
  * Menu and Button interfaces to explore the benefits/problems of each
  * User involvement in testing
  * Implement the best interface
  * Develop a set of icons/images to make the interface more consistent

## How to achieve the goals ##
  * Write user stories of what the users will want to do
  * Gather input from HCI professionals
  * Test designs with users
  * Create prototypes for deliverables so work is not lost if the interface is not implemented
