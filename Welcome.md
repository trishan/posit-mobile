**Welcome to the POSIT Development Wiki!**

POSIT consists of two complementary software components: a web server and a mobile app. POSIT-mobile is written in Android. POSIT-server is written in PHP and uses an MySQL database. These Wiki pages provide some background and tutorial materials and documentation about POSIT's design.

If you are ready to jump right in, go straight to the repository (Mercurial) and download some code. Otherwise take a look at some of the tutorial pages.
