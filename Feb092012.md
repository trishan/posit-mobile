# Project Plans #

_Eric_ – UI Upgrade
  * Consistency between phone and tablet

_Andrew_ – Generic Syncing
  * Issue – may have to make some changes on server side
  * Attribute value pairs and sent as string
  * Want to come up with a way so that you don’t have to modify a database table

_Brittney_ – Enhancing Map of Finds
  * Look at server code if time permits
  * In proposal, talk about scope of project

_Elias_ – Bluetooth Communication of Finds
  * Must be converted to plugin (is architecture strong enough to handle it?)

_Yemi_ – Plugin to read Barcode/QR Code
  * Possible expansion - create barcode based on find
  * Function plugin
  * Could consider building into core
  * Poke around in old POSIT repository to look for code (although may not be useful – it was for authenticating the phone (to read barcode on registration site)
  * One use would be to (for basic find (name, id)), read that info off barcode into AddFind form
  * How much data you can be stored in 2D barcode?

_Rob_ – Toggle Plugins on/off, List Plugins Installed
  * Will require lots of iteration
  * Design may not be worked out for a while

# Blogpost #

  * Eric will post on Android
  * Next week we will post a project launch summary


# For Next Week #

  * Write-up abstract, send to Ralph
  * Aim to have proposal finished in two weeks (although it can be modified in terms of design)
